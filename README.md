## backend-workspace
The purpose of this repository is to act as a digital notebook, tracking and holding the projects that I create and any useful information that I learn throughout the Backend Development course.

## Documentation
### Overview
This Backend Development repository workspace includes four folders, each correlating to different units in the course. Within each folder is a README.md file, where I will be providing information on the 
- Features
- Teachnologies used
- Instructions
for each project. Git-reference.md will be where I store any git commands that I learn. The learning-log.md file is where I will be documenting my backend development goals. The resources.md file will be where I list any useful backend development links that I discover.

### Learning Objectives
- Build RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js with proper CRUD operations
- Design relational databases with efficient relationships and data persistence
- Implement secure authentication and role-based authorization systems
- Handle errors gracefully and validate user input for production-ready applications
- Write comprehensive tests and deploy applications to cloud platforms
- Document APIs professionally and manage code with version control
- Create applications that demonstrate enterprise-level backend capabilities

### How I Plan to Use This Repository
I plan to take advantage of every feature in this repository. Having all of my projects in one place will be extremely helpful as it will be easy to search for references on previous projects as I work through the course. Having files specifically for documenting and listing resources, code, and keeping track of my learning, will also help with ease of access. My goal is to consistently update each file with new information each week as I complete projects from this course. This repository will act as not only a collection of my completed projects, but also as a collection of my ideas and learning process.
